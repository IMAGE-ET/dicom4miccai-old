DICOM4MICCAI is a tutorial satellite event to [MICCAI 2017](http://www.miccai2017.org/satellite-events).

This page is work in progress to organize materials for this tutorial. Stay tuned for updates!

# [](#scope)Scope

The objective of this tutorial is to introduce MICCAI community to the capabilities of the DICOM standard related to the storage of the data typically produced in the process of quantitative image analysis.

Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) is both the format most commonly used (by the manufacturers of the medical imaging equipment) and probably most commonly despised (by the medical imaging researchers).

In this tutorial we will attempt the impossible: to convince the attendees that DICOM can, and perhaps should, be used for storing your processing results such as segmentations, parametric maps, volumetric measurements and more!

Our tutorial will consist of the presentations followed by hands-on activities
using open source tools.

# [](#format)Format (tentative!)

## [](#talks)Talks

[Ron Kikinis](http://www.spl.harvard.edu/pages/People/kikinis): **Standards for medical image computing - why?**

[David Clunie](http://www.dclunie.com/): **DICOM: Overview and historical perspective**

[Andrey Fedorov](https://fedorov.github.io): **DICOM for Quantitative Imaging**

[Marco Nolden](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=sNoLhxIAAAAJ&hl=en): **Standardizing on DICOM for oncology use cases**

## [](#handson)Hands-on

* **Peeking inside the DICOM data**: This session will introduce basic tools that allow to explore and visualize DICOM data, and will demonstrate the basic concepts related to the data stored in the DICOM file.
* **Standardized representation of image segmentation: from NRRD to DICOM and back**: On an example from a realistic research usage scenario, the attendees will be guided over the steps needed to convert a segmentation result stored in a common research format into a DICOM representation.
* **Visualization and end-user tools: 3D Slicer and MITK**: In this session the attendees will use two popular medical image computing platforms to experience the advantages of using standardized representation of research data, and learn about how such support can be integrated into an end-user tool.

# [](#preregister)Pre-registration - coming up!
