DICOM4MICCAI is a tutorial satellite event to MICCAI 2017.

This page is work in progress to organize materials for this tutorial. Stay tuned for updates!

# [](#scope)Scope

The objective of this tutorial is to introduce MICCAI community to the capabilities of the DICOM standard related to the storage of the data typically produced in the process of quantitative image analysis.

Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) is both the format most commonly used (by the manufacturers of the medical imaging equipment) and probably most commonly despised (by the medical imaging researchers).

In this tutorial we will attempt the impossible: to convince the attendees that DICOM can, and perhaps should, be used for storing your processing results such as segmentations, parametric maps, volumetric measurements and more!

Our tutorial will consist of the presentations followed by hands-on activities
using open source tools.

**__Ron Kikinis__ - “Standards for medical image computing - why?”**

Dr. Kikinis is the founding Director of the Surgical Planning Laboratory, Department of Radiology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, and a Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School. He received his M.D. degree from the University of Zurich, Switzerland, in 1982. In 2004 he was appointed Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School. In 2009 he was the inaugural recipient of the MICCAI Society "Enduring Impact Award". During the mid-80's, Dr. Kikinis developed a scientific interest in image processing algorithms and their use for extracting relevant information from medical imaging data. Since then, this topic has matured from a fairly exotic topic to a field of science.

**__David Clunie__ - “DICOM: Overview and historical perspective”**

Dr. David Clunie is a radiologist, medical informaticist, DICOM open source software author and editor of the DICOM standard. He was formerly the co-chair of the IHE Radiology Technical Committee and industry co-chairman of the DICOM Standards Committee, as well as being a member or chairman of several of the DICOM working groups, including structured reporting, digital x-ray, compression, interchange media, base standard, display, mammography, clinical trials and small animal imaging. He is an active participant in many clinical trial and radiology organizations and working groups, and has a special interest in radiation dose informatics.

**__Andrey Fedorov__ - “DICOM for Quantitative Imaging”**

Andrey Fedorov is an Assistant Professor in Radiology at the Surgical Planning Laboratory (SPL), Department of Radiology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Andrey joined SPL in 2009 after obtaining his PhD in Computer Science from The College of William and Mary in Virginia. His research is in translation and validation of medical image computing technology in clinical research applications, with the focus on quantitative imaging, imaging informatics and image-guided interventional procedures.

**__Marco Nolden__ - “Standardizing on DICOM for oncology use cases”**

Marco Nolden did his doctorate in Medical Informatics in 2013. He is leading the Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit (MITK) team within the Medical Image Computing group in the German Cancer Research Center. His work focuses on research enabling technologies, interoperability, open source and application-oriented research in radiology, surgery and radiation oncology. In several multi-institutional projects he researches solutions for translating methods and algorithms into tools for validation on a larger scale and handling research data in a structured and standardized way.
